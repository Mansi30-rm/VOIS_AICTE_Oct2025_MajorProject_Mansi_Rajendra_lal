# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** to uncover insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform.  
It focuses on identifying trends related to **content type**, **release year**, **genres**, **countries**, and **ratings**, along with data cleaning and visualization.

## Project Objectives
- To explore and clean the Netflix dataset  
- To identify **which type of content (Movies or TV Shows)** dominates the platform  
- To analyze **year-wise trends** in content addition  
- To find **top genres**, **popular countries**, and **leading directors**  
- To visualize insights through Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas → Data cleaning & analysis  
  - NumPy → Numerical operations  
  - Matplotlib → Visualizations  
  - Seaborn → Advanced visual charts  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)** for coding and analysis  
- **Dataset:** Netflix Dataset (CSV format)

## Key Insights
- Movies are more frequent than TV Shows on Netflix  
- The year **2019** had the highest number of new releases  
- Popular genres include **Dramas**, **Comedies**, and **Documentaries**  
- Most content comes from the **United States**, **India**, and **United Kingdom**  
- Ratings are mostly in **TV-MA**, **TV-14**, and **R** categories  

## Recommendations
- Netflix can focus on producing more **regional content** (India & UK have high growth)  
- Expand in **Drama and Comedy** genres due to their popularity  
- Maintain a balanced ratio between **Movies and TV Shows** for diverse audiences
